    <h1>Re-thinking education</h1>
    <h2><em>What it means choosing a different path to the (currently) unknown</em></h2>

    <p>First day of this course: I wake up just like any other day, I go to work. Just enough anxiety to give me slight stomach pain. At this point I still have no idea what I'm stepping into. I just have this crazy feeling deep inside that this will change my life.</p>

    <p>Five days have passed, and many, many emotional changes. I had to challenge my own concepts of learning, my fears, my insecurities. But when I woke up this morning I realized this is all worth it.</p>

    <p>I haven't felt this alive in a long time.</p>

    <p>When I heard Shereef's words this big revelation suddenly came to me: my education "mindset" was stopping me from getting the best out of this experience. Code bootcamps are about creating something with a group of people and that is different as well as awesome. I look forward to immerse myself on this journey and see what it leads me to.</p>
