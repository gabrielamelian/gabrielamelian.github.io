        <h2>And then we started Javascript</h2>
        <p>
          Riiightt... This is week 4, yuss. So we had to start learning Javascript this week, which I was kind of looking forward too. The reason for that is that I'm not really good with design (nor I want to be), and HTML and CSS feel like design but instead of using Photoshop or something you have to use code and math (so... like really painful and hard). You can evidence this on the fact that I gave up on making this website look good for now. But enough "crying over spilled milk"* (*direct translation from Spanish), let's get onto those sweet Javascript facts.
        </p>
        <h4>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
        <p>
          Let's imagine a webpage is like a house again, shall we? So HTML is like the structure of the house, divided in rooms, kitchen, garage, bathroom, garden. You have some basic stuff built in and so forth. CSS is what gives it style and character: color, placements, positioning of things inside it, etc. Javascript is what makes all the interactive parts work, like the washing machine, fridge, sink, TV, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forget about the house and think of a website again: HTML simply tell the browser "this is a paragraph, this is a title, this text goes here", CSS tells the browser "when you see that paragraph display it using this font, this size in this position". With Javascript you can automate actions that will happen when the user does certain things or under certain circumstances like "pick up the 'contact name' and 'phone number' that this user has entered and add it to this database on this position".
        </p>
        <h4>What are control flow and loops?</h4>
        <p>
          Imagine you have to do your laundry: you probably follow certain steps such as 'put clothes on washing machine', 'put soap on washing machine', 'start washing machine'. What happens if for example you are washing your delicate clothes? You will probably use cold water and a special setting, plus maybe you add fabric softener. We do this things because we have the analytical capacity to consider each case and make particular decisions accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to computers and programs you have to specify the different scenarios before hand in what they call control flows. These control flows are what tell the program "if faced with the following situation then do this". A loop is an specific form of control flow in which certain activities repeat again and again (hence the name loop) until certain circumstance is met.
        </p>
        <h4>What is the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals?</h4>
        <p>
          I like to think of arrays like numbered lists. You add your list of things like this: <code> var sweets = ["chocolate", "candy", "ice cream"] </code> and the computer interprets it as 0.chocolate, 1.candy, 2.ice cream. So if you want the computer to tell you "candy" for example you have to 'call it' using the corresponding number: <code>sweets[1]</code>. Objects however are more like tables to me (in an structural way) where you have an specific thing followed by it's value. For example <code> var meals = {breakfast: "toast", lunch: "stir fry", dinner: "soup"}</code>. If you want to ask the computer what's for dinner you will do it this way: <code>meals["dinner"]</code>.
        </p>
        <h4>What are functions and why are they useful?</h4>
        <p>
          To make it simple, a function is a set of code that performs certain action. You can think about it as an abstraction that we do in real life like for example "getting up": we use this expression to define a number of activities we do every morning before we are ready to face the world such as getting out of bed, getting a shower, putting clothes on, etc. We know that when somebody tells us to "get up" that we have to perform those activities. In programming we do this with functions, we define them by telling the computer "when I call this function I want you to run this code". Cool, huh?
