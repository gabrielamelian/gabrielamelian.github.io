        <h2>On how to ( not ) avoid bad situations</h2>
        <p>
          This is already week six of the crazy journey, and it comes with no less challenges and hard times. The assignment this week was to read the chapter on self-regulation and try to apply it as usual to our daily lives. I suppose the idea was that at this stage we were already able to master certain things about ourselves to be able to control emotional response. I have to say it did not work as expected for me.

          When programming there are many things that can cause frustration to any person. Personally I found super annoying trying to make design decisions with code (yes CSS, I'm looking at you!), plus have to make something look good when each browser and operating system is going to interpret it differently. Then you have to make it look good on all screen sizes!! The potential to spend hours and hours doing this it's stressing me already. And then after you spend several hours solving little problems that create new problems you brain is so roasted that you cannot see obvious things.

          I had this kind of thing happen to me this week a couple of times and I was supposed to apply this technique called Siberian North RailRoad SBNRR (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond). The theory says that you can realize when your head is creating this bad situation for you and stop for a second, breathe, realize what is happening, reflect about the hows and whys, and respond in a calm adult manner. It is a nice idea and most of the time it works: when they are really small problems or when you are in a good place emotionally already. However once the frustration built up on the back of my consciousness the moment came when I could not take it anymore and started crying and feeling like total crap.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this explosion of frustration and sadness I was able to take some time to meditate and that helped me a bit more. I spend all that time alone with myself and I decided to give myself a break and not expect to do everything perfectly when I only started learning this 6 weeks ago.
