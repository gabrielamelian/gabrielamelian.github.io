        <h2>How to build beautiful sites that work everywhere</h2>
        <p>
          This week we had to learn everything about making responsive websites starting for our blog. It was interesting to really think about this topic that I'm used to just take for granted. A website should just work in your phone right? Well, it's not that easy of course...
        </p>
        <p>
          Not so long ago, the norm was to design for the desktop version of the webpage and then either adapt this design to work on phones or create a completely different version of the page called mobile version, or furthermore, a mobile application. This meant a lot more maintenance and extra work that needed to be done in order to keep the content updated on both versions as well as the fact they will probably have different features all together, not to mention a separated set of code and platforms on the apps. But technology is constantly evolving and in the past few years we have seen a rise in the use of all kinds of devices such as tablets, smartphones, smart-tvs, etc. that consequently have  all sorts of different screen sizes and controls.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design for desktop was not longer working as well and it was time to devise a new strategy to make websites that will work and look good on all -or most- devices. This is where responsive design comes along. The concept of responsive design means to create a single website to suit all needs, not mobile versions or apps. In order to do this developers use tools in CSS that allow the page contents to change depending on the screen size.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think Responsive Design is only going to get more and more important over time as people tend to use their mobile devices more over desktop computers. I personally interact way more with websites through my phone than my desktop PC. I use the computer only to watch movies and play videogames, besides of work of course. I pretty much do everything else on my phone including my banking, emails, shopping, recharging the bus card, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next big concept we learned was Frameworks, and a really cool one it is. Frameworks are a set of predefined styles that allows the developers to do certain things easier and faster. They vary from more simple to really complex ones that have many features. To put it in simple words: somebody found solutions to make things work in a certain way and they share it with others so they don't have to create it again from zero (no need to re-invent the wheel).
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we have this other cool thing called Wireframes, which are sort of schemes or simple drawings of what you will want your website to look like before starting the design process. Wireframes allow you to have some idea of the position of the different elements of the page without adding any style elements yet. Here you can see some examples of the wireframes I made for this personal website.

        <div class="four columns">
          <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="Desktop blog wireframe">
        </div>
        <p>
          I made many mistakes when trying to implement these, he he. The most noticeable one was that I completely missed the "Home" button when doing the mobile version ('doh!'). Then I had this great idea of making a collapsible navigation bar which I might not be able to implement until I know anything about Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Work in progress" should be the title of the site now, but one day, one day!...
