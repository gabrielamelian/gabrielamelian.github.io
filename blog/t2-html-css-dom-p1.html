        <h3>Question time though!</h3>
          <h4>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM?</h4>
            <p>
              Perhaps of my background on film I though about it like the steps to make a movie. HTML is like the script with the core of the story, CSS would be the storyboard and vision of the director and DOM would be the interpretation of that vision by the cast and crew. The movie would be what the final user see on a website.

          <h4>What is meant by boxifying design?</h4>
            <p>
              When a developer receives a design from a designer this one comes in the form of an image or composition in Photoshop. In oder to transform this into elements that compose a website it's necessary to visualize how we are going to create all that on HTML. Boxifying means that we look at the design and find the different sections and elements and mark them with boxes either with paper and pencil, doing cutouts or with an image editor.
            </p>
          <h4>What is the box model?</h4>
            <p>
              This concept refers to a graphical representation of how CSS interprets HTML elements that consists of a base box with the content, another box that shows the separation of the content from the border, next is the border itself and finally the margin. This is really useful to manage objects and the space that surrounds them as well as the interactions with other objects.
