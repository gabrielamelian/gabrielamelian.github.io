        <h2>Trying to find motivation through understanding of the inner self is hard work</h2>
        <p>
          So this week we had to read the chapter of the book that talks about motivation. It explains that there are three kinds of happiness: Pleasure, Passion and Purpose, and how aspiring to the latest is the best way to find sustainable joy throughout life. So far so good, this kind of makes sense as when you are doing something that really means something to you, you will stick to it through cold and hard and still feel really good with yourself. From there on the book tries to help you find this "higher purpose" and man, it was a wild ride.

          Finding out my values was not too hard because I did some similar soul-searchy thing last year. They came back this pretty broad things like: "Justice", "Love", "Honesty" and other general concepts, so far so good. From there though we jumped to the following exercise: <em>"Find your ideal future. Write for seven minutes with the following in mind: If everything in my life, starting from today, meets or exceeds my most optimistic expectations, what will my life be in five years?"</em> * queue to crickets noise *.
          I honest to god sat in silence wrestling with my thoughts trying to come up with something that would make sense. It was like trying to solve one of the algorithm challenges for a long time and ended up with nothing. I do not know where I might be in 5 years, or 10 years, or when I die. I just don't know, and I'm conscious that I don't know. This is not the first time I tried to find out as it has been the question in my mind for like six or seven years since I left Uni. If only all this searching inside yourself could help, but nah.

          Next topic (yes, the previous one did not finish but it will probably take way more meditation and time, he he), they go ahead and try to teach you to be optimistic which sort of makes sense and at the same time is a bit weird. The good things I took out of it were that we put so much weight on the things that go wrong in our life in contrast with the ones that go well and that is quite true. I believe it would be good to keep the success more present, specially when going through rough times. The weird part is that they try to teach you this techniques where you "notice your emotions but let them go" (good and bad), which is kind of like saying "you are some sort of zen master with no emotions" or a Dalek or something. I feel (yes, I said feel, ha!) the line between separating yourself from your emotions and becoming a sociopath is quite fine. If the solution to go through low moments in life is to make yourself not feel nothing at all and believe yourself to be invincible like the ocean waves, well, that is hitman material right there.
