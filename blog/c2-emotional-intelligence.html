      <h2><em>About meditation and other hippie dippie stuff</em></h2>

        <p>
          First off I would like to say I do believe in meditation in what you will call an instinctive way. I know it works even if we don't know exactly the science of the how. I think science will eventually catch up and gives some explanations on the power of the mind and stuff. Because a topic may have some taboo or stigma as to be "for hippies" doesn't mean that the can't be some true to it.

          Right, so this week we had to read  the first chapter off <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Search-Inside-Yourself-Unexpected-Achieving/dp/0062116932">Search Inside Yourself</a>. I made the mistake to read the introduction which only made me angry and put me in the wrong disposition to keep reading (This is due to my preconceptions against big corporations and the books over-praising of our Google overlords). However once I actually started reading the concepts I have to say my opinion changed considerably (I still won't praise our Google overlords though). I always wanted to find some actual scientific proof of the benefits of meditation and the author showed these to back up each of his theories. Not only that, but it was making some great points like saying it is not some sort of magic mysterious thing but only exercise for the mind.

          I had already started to read the book last week in a crazy attempt to find a bit of peace of mind when I was most stressed, so I was reading through the pages and trying to practice the exercises at the same time hoping to find some calm. Obviously this was not a piece of cake: concentration was hard and I couldn't help my mind going to some dark places and second guessing myself all the time. Despite all this, when I was not actively trying to calm down I was actually able to find my peace.

          The interesting thing about the process I'm going through with this book is that it made me think how my body and mind tell me things even when I'm not aware of them. For example, when I am in a good place feeling that I am being true to myself and doing what I want to do with my life the mindfulness comes naturally. I start to taste every moment in my life and appreciate the things of the moment. I'm just watching out the window on the bus and looking at the people and the city and feeling this amazing boost of energy and happiness. There is more to it I'm sure and I'm grateful that I can explore this to make more sense of it and perhaps learn to use it.
