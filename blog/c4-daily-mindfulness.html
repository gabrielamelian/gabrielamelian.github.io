        <h2>Mindfulness conversation</h2>
        <p>
          This week we went through the concept of "Mindfulness conversation" which is a really cool exercise where you have to attentively listen to somebody talking for four minutes and then tell them what you interpret they were trying to say. Then the speaker can tell you the things that you got right and wrong and in general clarify what was said. This is a good way to really see if you understand the other person.

          I practiced this with my partner and it was a sort of funny/awkward situation. We have been living together for 5 years and I feel I know him so well it would be really easy for me to interpret what he said. I was not wrong on this, he he. It's funny when you have that kind of connection with someone, that you can tell how they are feeling even when they are not explicitly telling you. For him it was a bit different though, he said he specifically felt uncomfortable but understands why it's a good thing to do.

          The thing with meditation as an "exercise for the mind" is that it is, well... exercise. I struggle with kinds of maintained physical activity. In order to lose 10kg that I gained when I got to NZ I had to have PT sessions for over a year for example. So how can I have the drive to push myself into doing something every day? I'm honestly not sure. The buddy system seems to have worked for me in the past so I will give that a go.
