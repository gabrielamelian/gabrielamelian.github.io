        <h2>Is there such a thing as too much reflection?</h2>
        <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>
          <p>
            My understanding is that this a convention used to create easily customizable structures for the elements of a website using a certain number of columns. This kind of design should also help the user to understand and navigate easily through the different elements.
          </p>
        <h4>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>
          <p>
            The cool thing about this new trend is that you would be able to create a single webpage that can look good on lots of different devices ditching the good old mobile pages and other high maintenance stuff. I mean, how cool is that right?
          </p>
        <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4>
          <p>
            On HTML this means using the elements provided in the structure they were intended to so they have internal coherence. I believe the equivalent would be to use the correct structure to write a newspaper article for example: you wouldn't put the title in the middle of a paragraph and so forth.
          </p>
        <h4>Interesting facts</h4>
          <p>
            This was just something curious I found (and perhaps slightly annoying): How silly is it that most of the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> are actually images instead of CSS styling? I'll go with VERY silly. I basically learned that you can do a lot of things with Photoshop *facepalm*.
