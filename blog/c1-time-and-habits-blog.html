      <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
      <h2><em>About starting a bootcamp while working full time and other bad ideas</em></h2>

      <p>
        This is THE topic of the week for me. It all started when reality kicked in on Monday afternoon. It was 7PM, I had just finished the online presentation and I was lost and confused. I realized soon enough why: I had missed half of the orientation material due to clicking through without thinking and overexcitement to get enrolled. It was quite steep (or downhill depending how you look at it) from there on.

        When I was applying for EDA, I was kindly told that I might not be able to work full time while on phase 0 and boy, they were right! Coming back home at 6:30pm demolished and hungry didn't make for an awesome learning experience.

        From all the bad you can get some good in the end, and in this case this pratical "stress overdose" of the first few days meant that I was looking for support on the material provided. I was reading the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Search-Inside-Yourself-Unexpected-Achieving/dp/0062116932">Search Inside Yourself</a> whenever I had the time such as when I was commuting or my lunch break. I realized I had to focus on what was most important for me and spend most of my energy on it.

        Of all the articles on the "Working with Time" topic, the <a href="http://paidtoexist.com/counterintuitive-productivity/">Counterintuitive productivity</a> was definitely the one that stroke a cord. I loved it so much that I had to post a quote from it on my Facebook feed:
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>People don’t procrastinate because they’re lazy. People procrastinate as a self-defense mechanism against doing stuff they despise or doing things too mechanically. Instead, ask yourself What would I absolutely love to do and feel immensely proud of doing today?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        I can relate to that so well, and understanding it gave me the ablity to break the vicious cycle of self hate. I can proudly say that I decided to do what makes me happy. Love what you do and concentration and energy will follow.
