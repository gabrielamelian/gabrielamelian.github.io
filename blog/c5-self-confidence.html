        <h2>Self awareness and self confidence to understand the inner self</h2>
        <p>
          As every week, we had to continue reading the "Search Inside Yourself" book in an ever so necessary attempt to understand ourselves better and also feel better. The topic was something really interesting to me. The first time I heard the concept of "self awareness" was through a close friend that mentioned it to me almost casually as a way to find happiness. Knowing who you are and what you like it's the first step towards doing what you want. If only it were so simple, he he.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the book they mention mindfulness as a way to self awareness in a way that they are almost the same. To me it seems a little bit more complicated than that, but I can see how meditation and other techniques can help you on your way to understanding yourself. What I'm trying to say with this is: to me one thing is to realize "my heart rate is racing and I am feeling angry" and another thing is to be self aware "I'm feeling angry because I do not work well when people uses harsh language to me with no reason, this is because I was raised in a different way, I'm from another culture and I don't understand the codes, and I was bullied when young".
        </p>
        <p>
          This week we learned two mindfulness techniques to help with this self awareness topic: body scanning and Journaling. Body scanning means paying attention to all parts of your body when meditating or otherwise, and Journaling means to take some time to write to yourself about different things. I tried both. The first one reminds me of the first part of other meditation tapes that I have followed on the past and it feels to me that it puts you more in contact with your organic self, like you are a well oiled machine working as per specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Journaling was another story, because I am used to doing this when I am in situations that cause me great anxiety like being surrounded by a group of people I don't know and I'm all alone. I used writing in my notebook as a way to escape the eye of others, as a way to say "don't talk to me, I'm busy writing". Funny enough when I look at what I wrote those times it just paints some picture of myself that I don't normally have present. It feels really useful to write like this, like you can have a direct connection to your subconscious and talk to your primal self. Unfortunately my primal self seems to be quite cryptic so I still can't say that I've figured myself out. But trying helps!
        </p>
        <p>
          I had to reflect about the statement "My emotions are not me". But my emotions are part of me, some emotions are the best of me: Love, compassion, empathy, joy. What am I without them? Just an empty shell.
