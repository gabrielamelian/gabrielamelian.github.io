        <h2>Week 3 = AKA The first week I don't finish on time</h2>
        <p>
          We had this beautiful concept to learn this week "process over product". This means to be more happy about the learning process than the actual results which I can probably say I have accomplished... Because the site is far far away from what I would like it to be. Unfortunately this past week was the busiest for me yet since I started the course. Many commitments made impossible for me to work more than 6 hours on the website, and it looks quite ugly I'm afraid. I all honesty, I think it even looked better before. I did learn some important things though, so there is that.

          About the meditation concept, we had to continue reading the Search Inside Yourself book. At his point I think I'm on Chapter three. I suppose what I see different for meditation now after reading this book that I didn't do before is that you can have different kinds of meditation and mindfullness, not all the traditional seating in a lotus position and trying not to think about anything. As I mentioned before, I did this other kinds of meditation before in my life, listening to tapes and such, but this means that we can also practice it just by walking or talking to people.

          There was one of the techniques that I found most interesting and memorable: using joy as an object of meditation. This means to focus on those little moments in life that bring bliss and happiness to you, like a nice meal, holding your partner's hand, a conversation with a friend, and give it your full attention. This is so simple and beautiful, and it helps you "live the moment" in a great fuller way. I can definitely see myself applying this from now on.
