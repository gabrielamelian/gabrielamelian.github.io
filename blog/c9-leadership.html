        <p>
          Ok, I'm getting a bit skeptical on the teachings of the Search Inside Yourself book so I apologize in advance for sounding a bit sarcastic this time. The problem is not so much the concepts but perhaps the way it is presented. They want to teach you all these qualities to be a good leader which is basically just being a good person, but for the reason that you will be more successful if you do and you will be able to influence people to do what you want and to follow you. I cannot relate to that because I was brought up to believe that the main reason to be a good person is because is the right thing to do and because other human beings deserve your respect, not because you can take advantage from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have had many experiences of bad leadership in my work life, and not all of them were due to lack of compassion or "not being a good person". Many times a good person can be a bad leader if they don't have support or the means to help everybody on their team. I think it's overly simplistic to put it down to that. And in any case, I am not interested in becoming a good leader myself for that matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the bright side, they taught us this meditation technique where you visualize good vibes from you and others and share it with everyone that I really liked. I do this every time I meditate since I was a child naturally. It's an important part of me to send all of this good energy to people I care about: my parents, my siblings, my friends, etc. This time I tried and extended it to everyone I know, and then to the city (can't quite do the whole world yet, it feels so much, he he). It was a good thing to feel and do.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book also tells you to try and visualize yourself taking the pain and negativity away from other people and transforming it to goodness, this is a different kind of meditation called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonglen">Tonglen</a>. Again, I have done this in the past albeit I didn't know it was called that or that it was an official practice. I did it for people I care about that was going through a hard time. My intention was to help them through a difficult situation, so it was not focused on everyone on the planet of being done with the intention to better myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find it hard to believe that you can "train your altruism" using these or any techniques really. I mean, if you are only helping other people because you want to get a benefit for yourself, isn't that the opposite of caring for others? Or maybe this is all an elaborate trick from the book author to trick selfish people into not being such a bad a person?

          Oh my, oh my, this blog post is supposed to be really long...
        </p>
        <h4>Having a difficult conversation</h4>
        <p>
          Another topic that we went through this week is "how to have difficult conversations", which might be useful I think, specially the part when it teaches you to try and write better emails. Again, I've had had many experiences in my work life of these kind of things going wrong and also going well. During more than one and a half years I worked in a place complete separated from the rest of my team and from that I learned the importance of a face to face conversation, and to always talk with kindness and love to your colleagues. Unfortunately that did not make it a success story in the end anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          From another work experience I used these techniques to try and reconnect with a member of my team from which situations led us to be one against the other over a particular thing. I was able to reconnect with him by acknowledging what he was going through and explaining to him how I was feeling. I should point out however that to do this you have to be in a place of calm yourself to be able to see beyond feelings of anger and fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the same tone of the rest of the post, this does not work all the time, for the reason that not everyone can understand this instinctively (or read Search Inside Yourself) and people can still feel threatened by you even you have a nice conversation with them. Also, some people will just not like you and what can you possibly do about that.
        </p>

          Sorry that this post is a bummer, that is all folks!
