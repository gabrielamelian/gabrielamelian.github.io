        <h2>Some more basic Javascript</h2>
        <p>
          This week we have a look at some of the cornerstones of writing code: the use of parentheses, braces, brackets, and single and double quotes. They are used to tell the program to interpret things a certain way, much like punctuation does in written language. Below are all of the case uses that I can think of these on Javascript.
        </p>
        <h4>Parentheses ( )</h4>
        <p>
          These are used in a way that is similar to maths in the sense that you can use them to tell the computer to do some action first before proceeding to the next. The difference is that it not only applies to mathematical operations, but also logical and others. It is telling the program "do this first, then proceed with the rest".<br />
          <code>
            (6 + 6) + "is the result of the operation"
          </code><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Following this they are used in loops to express a condition that needs to happen for the loop to continue or in a simple "if" to proceed with the content of the expression.<br />
          <code>
            if (winner === true){
              lib.displayMessage('You win!');
            }
          </code><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Parentheses also define the arguments that will be passed to a function. This is done when we "call" the function as well. They way to write this is to put the name of the function first and then the parenthesis with whatever the information we want it to use. When we have a function that does not use any arguments we still add them but this time empty.<br />
          <code>
            generateBoard();
          </code><br />
          <code>
            function countSurroundingMines (cell) { }
          </code>
        </p>
        <h4>Brackets [ ]</h4>
        <p>
          These are used to define arrays and to contain the things in them.<br />
          <code>
            var cells = ["cell1", "cell2"]
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          They are also used to index parts of the array in order to find them from outside of it. All elements on an array have an order number starting from 0 so if we want to get the second object on our array we call it like this:<br />
          <code>
            cells[1]
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          In a similar way to arrays, brackets are also used to find a property for an object, only in this case the property name needs to be in quotes or double quotes (string).<br />
          <code>
            board = {cells: "black"}
          </code><br />
          <code>
            board["cells"]
          </code>
        </p>
        <h4>Braces { }</h4>
        <p>
          Braces are used to define Objects in Javascript as in the previous example<br />
          <code>
            board = {cells: "black"}
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          They also wrap functions and loops when expressing the action to be done.
        </p>
        <h4>Single quotes ' ' and double quotes "  "</h4>
        <p>
          They are used to define the limits of a string. You can use one of the other but not a combination of both.
