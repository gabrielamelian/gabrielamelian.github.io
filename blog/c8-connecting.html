        <h2>The importance of empathy</h2>
        <p>
          This was week eight, only one more week before bootcamp and stress levels remain about the same. We had two big peer programming projects to complete last week and this one which were super interesting and hard. For the cultural blog this week we had to read chapter 7 of the Search Inside Yourself book which talks about empathy as a way to have more effective communication in the workplace plus be happy, etc etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book points out that empathy is a natural occurring thing for humans which is made easier when we see the other person as similar to oneself. I suppose this is true, in a way people feel more disconnected from other people that they don't know, like when you can't relate to people from a certain nationality of race. In this sense I learned so much in the past 5 years since I came to New Zealand and started traveling more. When you get out of your comfort zone and connect with other people that you thought you were so different from you realize we all have reasons to think and behave the way we do, and that is ok. In that sense I'm sure everyone will benefit from traveling and really sharing a different culture at least once in their lives. Of course you can do that and still learn nothing, he he.
        </p>
        <p>
          Funny enough, and not to sound pretentious, but I already try to apply what they mention in the book on my everyday life anyway. I don't see it as a "technique" in the sense for me to take and advantage of, but it's just simple logic: after you realize the big truth which is that everyone looks at the world through their own glasses you can try and see beyond yours. What I mean by this is that if you don't understand why a person would do this or that you could try putting yourself on that person's situation and you will most likely see that they were not trying to just upset you or be mean on purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there are these exercises that they mention where you have to be able to read and understand your job/organization as it was a human (on the book I mean), which I tried to follow thinking about my previous job. I realized that I had already thought about it long and hard and that is why I came to the conclusion that it was not the place for me. As an organization it had its own objectives and idiosyncrasy which did not agree with mine. Knowing this did not help me stay there, on the contrary it pushed me away.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I could take something from what I read it would be that if everyone tried to understand each-other more and put themselves in the other person's shoes, there will be less suffering and misunderstandings, however this is not true most of the time and it makes it even harder.
